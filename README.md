# Projeto-CadKlassmatt
This Project was created to automate the whole task involved on register itens in web, through Klassmatt web site.

The main point is based on Python libraries tha has a common use on automation tasks on web, Selenium Web Driver Package. It was developed a interactive graphic user interface (GUI) through the PyQT5 library to register your itens and follow the sins (Klassmatt Identifiers numbers) that has been created by the user, also there is a mechanism that a user may send e-mails automatically with all records that was approved and those ones was recorded by him/her, through his/her e-mail account on Oultlook App.

Note:

I. If a user receive the Klassmatt registration request from his/her e-mail, it is strongly recommended create a Inbox aimed to receive those sort of requests named Klassmatt.

II. The Excel Sheet model of record data to input is available in documetation (It was named STANDARD_SHEET.xlsx).

III. There is a available Executable in Google Drive according the Link bellow:
              https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mbfm4TqaNV_pIqYJ3vS2IG7emtJXgyLr?usp=sharing

IV. It is possible that user's browser version is not supported for the application standard driver, it would start a alert. To solve this kind of problem, the user must dowload a compatible WebDriver according his/her browser (Chrome, Mozila, Ie and/or Edge), and replace the executable file in the path: '...\Module\__xbase__\__files__\__drives__'.
